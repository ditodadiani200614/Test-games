SHMUP-GAME

This is a 2D space shooter game where the player controls a spaceship and tries to destroy falling meteors. 
The goal is to survive as long as possible and achieve the highest score by shooting down obstacles in space. 
The gameplay is simple but includes visual effects, sound, and power-ups to make it more dynamic.
